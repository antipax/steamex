Steamex
=======

Steamex is a library for interacting with Steam Auth/Profiles.

If you are a Phoenix user, please look at the documentation for
`Steamex.Auth.Phoenix` for a quick-start guide.

If you use another Plug-based framework (or just Plug by itself), please see
the `Steamex.Auth.Plug` documentation for more information.

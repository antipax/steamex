    Router helpers for using Steamex auth with Phoenix.
  """

  @doc """
    Inserts a route for the Steamex auth return_to URL.

    This route (by default) is:

        get "/steamex/return_to", Steamex.Auth.Plug, [], as: :steamex_auth_return_to

    You can customize the return_to URL via the first parameter.

    The plug options can be altered via the second parameter. Please refer to
    `Steamex.Auth.Plug` for available options (if any).

    The router options can be altered via the final parameter. Please note that
    if you change the `:as` option, you must also alter your invocation of the
    `Steamex.Auth.Phoenix.View` helper. In this case it is suggested that you
    add your own view helper that calls the Steamex one with the appropriate
    options.
